# Project Lu

Project Lu is a personal web-space where I can explore and create content using overly-complicated tools (why make an easy blog?). Web-creation and design is a side-hobby of mine, and if you notice anything that could be improved programmically, let me know!

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
